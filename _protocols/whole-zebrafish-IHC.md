# Whole-mount zebrafish immunohistochemistry

## Introduction
This protocol has been tested with the following antibodies (antibody, supplier (may be more than one), clone ID (if known)):
- rabbit GFP - Torrey Pines BioLab (TP401)
- chicken GFP - abcam (ab13970)
- mouse Tubulin (Acetyl Lys40) - GeneTex (GTX16292) Sigma (T7451), 6-11B-1
- rabbit RFP (mCherry-suitable) - MBL (PM005)
- rabbit sox10 - GeneTex (GTX128374)

I generally use primary antibodies at 1:200, and secondary Alexa Fluor antibodies at 1:400.

## Materials
- 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)
- 1X PBS + 0.8% Triton-X100 (also works with Tween-20) i.e. PBST
- Methanol (MeOH)
- Proteinase K (10 mg/ml = 1000X, 20 mg/ml = 2000X)
- Normal Goat Serum
- Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
- Low Melting Point (LMP) agarose
- Glycerol

## Procedure

### Fixation
#### Options
- 4% PFA overnight at 4C
- 2% PFA over-weekend at 4C
- 4% PFA 1 hour/24 hpf at RT
- (If post-fixing dissection required) Sweet fix (4% PFA + 4% sucrose) for 3 hrs at RT or overnight at 4C

#### Rinse and dehydration
1. Rinse 2x in PBST.
2. Wash 3x 10 mins PBST on side on shaker. 
3. Dehydrate into MeOH:
- 1x 5 mins 50% MeOH/50% PBST
- 2x Rinse in 100% MeOH

4. Store at -20C in 100% MeOH at least overnight up to 6 months.

**NOTE** Rinsing and dehydrating with plain PBS works too.

### Day 1

#### Rehydration
1. 1x 5 mins 50% MeOH/50% PBST
2. 3x 5 mins PBST

#### Permeabilisation with Proteinase K in PBST

1. Varies with embryo age. Perform at RT with tube lying on the side on a nutator:
- Up to tailbud: no PK
- 2-10ss: in and out of 1X PK
- 10-15ss: 1 min 1X PK
- 16-26ss: 2 mins 1X PK
- 24h: 10-15 mins 1X PK
- 30h: 20 mins 1X PK
- 36-48h: 30 mins 1X PK
- 2.5d: 30 mins 1.5X PK
- 3d: 30 mins 2X PK
- 4d: 30 mins 3X PK
- 5d: 30 mins 4X PK

2. Rinse 3x in PBST.

#### Post-fixing
1. 4% PFA for 20 mins at RT.
2. Wash 3x 5 mins PBST.

#### Blocking
1. Make blocking solution fresh each time:
- 10% normal goat serum (NGS), 1% DMSO in PBST
2. Incubate 1 hour at RT on nutator.

#### Primary antibodies
1. Incubate in blocking solution at least overnight at 4C on nutator.

### Day 2
#### Washes	
1. Remove primary antibody (can be kept at 4C for reuse within a week).
2. Rinse 3x in PBST. 
3. Wash 6x 30 mins in PBST on nutator. 
**NOTE** If you incubate primary antibody over several days then wash more.

#### Secondary antibodies - keep dark
1. Centrifuge secondaries at 500g for 5 mins to pull down precipitates. Use supernatant for staining.
2. Incubate in PBST + secondary antibodies overnight at 4C or 3-4 hours at RT on nutator.

### Day 3
#### Washes and storage/imaging - keep dark
1. Rinse 3x in PBST. 
2. Wash 6x 30 mins on nutator.
3. If desired, perform a long over-weekend wash at 4C.

#### Storage - keep dark
1. Rinse PBST with PBS. 
2. Transfer to 50% glycerol/PBS.
3. Mount in 1% LMP agarose, immerse (if required) with PBS.
4. Image as soon as possible, samples keep alright for about a week or so.
