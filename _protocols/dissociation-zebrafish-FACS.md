# Dissociation of zebrafish larvae for FACS

## Introduction
This protocol has been tested on dissected heads/trunks and whole 30 hpf larvae to FAC-sort pineal cells (~40 cells per embryo, >80% viability) with a 100 µm nozzle. For negative gating, ~20 whole wild type embryos is usually sufficient.

## Materials
- RNase-free pipette tips and micro-centrifuge tubes, low-binding/retention grade , for cell work
- RNase-free pipette tips and micro-centrifuge tubes, normal retention i.e. not low-binding , for buffers and reagents
- Glass serological pipettes
- 50 ml RNase-free Falcon tubes
- 40 µm cell strainers (22363547, FisherScientific)
- 12X75 mm 5 ml polystyrene sterile round tubes with snap cap (734-0436, Falcon)
- DNaseI (10104159001, Sigma-Aldrich)
- Papain, 10 mg/ml i.e. 0.3 U/µl (10108014001, Sigma-Aldrich)
- ROCK inhibitor a.k.a. Y-27632 dihydrochloride (A3008, Generon UK)
- 10X HBSS, no calcium, no magnesium, no phenol red (14185052, ThermoFisher)
- Bovine Serum Albumin, heat shock fraction, protease free, essentially globulin free, pH 7, >=98% (A3059, Sigma-Aldrich)
- 1M HEPES solution (15630056, ThermoFisher)
- eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (65-0865-14, ThermoFisher)

## Procedure

### Pre-flight

Ensure following reagents are prepared in advance and stored appropriately.

- ROCK inhibitor; resuspend 10mg with 1 ml of DMSO to concentration of 10 mg/ml. Store in -20C.
- DNaseI; resuspend 50mg/100mg with 5 ml/10ml of nuclease-free water to final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Filter sterilise (0.22 µm) and store 1 ml aliquots at 4C for couple of days or -20C for long-term.
- eFluor 780 dye; dilute a small aliquot 1 in 10 with DMSO and store at -20C. Neat stock should be stored in -80C for long-term.
- Autoclave MilliQ DEPC water for making buffers and solutions, or use commercial UltraPure DNase/RNase-free distilled water.
